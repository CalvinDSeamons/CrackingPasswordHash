## Computer Security MD5 Encryption Cracker. 

The title is slightly misleading. This program does not actually crack the encryption but still lets us break into the encryption, in a sense. We use a large dictionary list of stolen and common passwords and encrypt them into MD5. We then compare the hashes and if we get a match we know what the encrypted password is. So in essence this is a combination of brute-force and relying on people to choose poor passwords. This dictionary list consists of roughly 1.5Billion passwords so make sure you have enough space if you decide to download it. 

If you ever find yourself with a large list of MD5 hashed passwords. You will most likely be able to crack it.
